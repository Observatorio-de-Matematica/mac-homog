This is a package of functions for solving Killing-type equations
on homogeneous spaces in Maxima computer algebra system:

http://maxima.sourceforge.net

It supports the following types of Killing equations:

- Killing(-Yano) forms -> kfsolve()
- Killing spinors -> kssolve()
- Killing spinor-valued forms -> stdksfsolve()

It works at infitesimal level, the homogeneous space is represented
as a pair (g,h) of a Lie algebra and its subalgebra, together with
the metric and spin representation. Some Lie algebras and homogeneous
spaces are preprogrammed.

SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF USAGE
=======================

load ("diag");
load ("grobner");
load ("amat.mac");
load ("homkil.mac");

/* 5-dimensional Berger sphere with family of metrics
   parametrized by s */
m : bergs (3, s);

/* set s as a parameter for solving */
setgcd2vars (s);

/* solve the equation for Killing 1-forms */
kfsolve (m, 1);
/* returns a list [p, c, s, r], where:
   p - number of passes needed for computation
   c - polynomial whose roots are singularities,
       i.e. additional solutions can exist if c = 0
   s - matrix whose columns are solutions (at the origin)
   r - Lie algebra representation on solutions whose
       exponential gives solutions at other points */
